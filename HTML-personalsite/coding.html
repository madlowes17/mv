    <h3>Coding</h3>
      <p>
        I started coding when I was only in year 1 which put me a huge step ahead when we started coding in year 3 at school. At the time we were ment to be only playing around with scratch while I had created a simple cat and mouse game on scratch.
        Now I am in year 5 and I have created this website myself using simple HTML and a coding course.</p>
