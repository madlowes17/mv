  <h4> Dance Style Dictionary</h4>

  <h5>Jazz</h5>
  <p>Jazz is one of the few dance styles that has variants.Its variant include jazz, comercial Jazz, Fosse Jazz, Lyrical Jazz and many more. Jazz has strong emphasis on Technique which is why in jazz classes words like chasse, chane and jete are
    common. To be a great Jazz dancer remember these rules a) technique b) Jazz hands are not a thing! c) always have energy!</p>
  <h5>Ballet</h5>
  <p>Ballet is the most technical and important dance style. Ballet is the most important because it is the foundation of every other dance style. Ballet is also one of the oldest forms of dance living today! It started in the Italian
    Renaissance in the fifteenth century. Remember Ballet is all about technique!</p>
  <h5>Musical Theatre</h5>
  <p>Musical Theatre is a fusion of singing, acting and dancing (which makes me a triple threat. Sorry but im not sorry!)which normally uses songs from movies or other musicals.This form of dance has more of a theatrical aspect but it can still have
    aspects of technique and many more aspects. The emotion in Musical Theatre is normally more of a happy or funny emotion with a problem or a point to get through the audience. When you see a Musical remember all the hard work that goes into it. <p/>
