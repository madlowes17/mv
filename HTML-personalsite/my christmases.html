    <h3> My Christmases</h3>
      <p>
        My christmas is normally a time to read performance runsheets and curl my hair. Christmas shows are always CHAOS! Especially at the "santa's arrival parade" There are always older girls snapping selfies and little kids running around with a
        smudged lip of striking red lipstick. The actual day might seem like an explosion, but the worst part is diffinetly the curls! Every morning of a show, I have to wake up to the smell of curling products and the feeling of a hot metal rod on the
        side of my head, creating these silly ringlets that make me look like frickin' Shirley Temple! Nevertheless, Christmas Shows are always a blast.
